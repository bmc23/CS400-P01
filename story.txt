My friend Sam is a good guy, he bouhgt me an ice cream cone even though he didn't have to. But when I bit into the ice cream cone it was pistachio, and I didn't have the heart to tell him that it was gross. He looked so happy with that big ol grin on his face. I thought Sam would know better than to ever get anyone pistachio ice cream like come on, its gross no matter who you ask. At least get something normal like vanilla. 
I couldn't believe that he actually bought me 2 scoops of pistachio. 1 scoop I could handle, but 2 is too much for anyone. I have a plan though. I'll use the heat of the sun to melt the ice-cream and pretend to drop it. As soon as this cloud blows over in a second, I'll start the plan.
