My friend Sam is a good guy, he bouhgt me an ice cream cone even though he didn't have to. But when I bit into the ice cream cone it was pistachio, and I didn't have the heart to tell him that it was gross. He looked so happy with that big ol grin on his face. I thought Sam would know better than to ever get anyone pistachio ice cream like come on, its gross no matter who you ask. At least get something normal like vanilla. 
Brigg's friend Sam felt as if something was wrong with his friend Briggs. He saw that he was stressing out about something and wanted to do something nice. In order to cheer
him up, Sam took Briggs to see the movie Uncut Gems. Unfortunately Briggs hated this movie even more than pistachio ice cream and told Sam that he was bad at gift giving, but this
didn't stop Sam, he was now determined to give Briggs the best gift ever.
