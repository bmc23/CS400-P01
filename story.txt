My friend Sam is a good guy, he bouhgt me an ice cream cone even though he didn't have to. But when I bit into the ice cream cone it was pistachio, and I didn't have the heart to tell him that it was gross. He looked so happy with that big ol grin on his face. I thought Sam would know better than to ever get anyone pistachio ice cream like come on, its gross no matter who you ask. At least get something normal like vanilla.
